Users with respective privileges (in the following called instructors) can use this block to upload videos via moodle to Opencast. These videos are transmitted to the Opencast system by the cronjob and create an event in the respective series there. The block can be used to automatically set the access privileges of moodle users enrolled in the course. All events belonging to the series are displayed in the block. This way, the instructors get an overview of all recorded lectures as well as planned ones. Further, if setup correctly, the instructors are able to restrict the visibility to moodle groups or prevent access by students at all. Installation The Opencast block plugin is available from GitHub as well as from the Moodle plugins directory . Requirements Min. Moodle Version: 3.8 Opencast API level: Minimum: v1.1.0 In addition to the roles to access the opencast API, the opencast user has to be provided with the role ROLE_GROUP_MH_DEFAULT_ORG_EXTERNAL_APPLICATIONS . Otherwise, moodle will not have the capabilities to write or read series created through moodle. This role can be changed, but has to be aligned with one of the roles you set under Roles . Installed and configured Opencast API tool . Features Upload videos to Opencast Record videos using Opencast studio Overview of recorded and planned videos in the course Download processed videos from Opencast Edit metadata and delete videos Restrict the visibility of videos to moodle groups or prevent access by students at all Allow teachers to start Opencast workflows for videos Linking an existing Opencast series to the course Import videos from other moodle courses by duplicating them Report problems to a support team with automatically including technical information In integration with the activity Opencast Video Provider : Provide the series or single videos as activity for students to watch directly in moodle Restrict the visibility using the extensive moodle activity access settings Configuration The block has many settings that allow the administrator to further specify the features or to turn them off. The configuration of the block is split up into six sections: General settings Appearance Additional features LTI module features Import videos features Workflow settings Capabilities There are additional capabilities, with which you can control the access to the features of the block. Capability Role in default configuration Description block/opencast:addactivity editingteacher, manager Add Opencast Video Provider activity for a series to course block/opencast:addactivityepisode editingteacher, manager Add Opencast Video Provider activity for an episode to course block/opencast:addlti editingteacher, manager Add Opencast LTI series module to course block/opencast:addltiepisode editingteacher, manager Add Opencast LTI episode module to course block/opencast:addvideo editingteacher, manager Add a video via Moodle to opencast block/opencast:createseriesforcourse manager Create a new series if block/course is not yet associated with one block/opencast:defineseriesforcourse manager Change the series ID which is associated with the block instance or rather course block/opencast:deleteevent editingteacher, manager Allows to delete a video as specified above block/opencast:downloadvideo editingteacher, manager Download processed videos block/opencast:manualimporttarget editingteacher, manager Manually import videos from other courses block/opencast:manualimportsource editingteacher, manager Manually import videos from a course block/opencast:startworkflow editingteacher, manager Start a preconfigured workflow for a video block/opencast:unassignevent - Allows to unassign a video from the series of the course as specified above. block/opencast:viewunpublishedvideos editingteacher, manager View the list of all videos of the course, which are available in opencast (even not published ones) Logging The execution of upload jobs are being logged, which can be viewed at Site administration -> Reports -> Logs . View the setting \"Site Errors\" instead of \"All activities\" you can view only those upload jobs, which failed. Placement This plugin is designed as block and, to be used, it will be initially added to a Moodle course by a teacher. The block shows a quick overview over the videos which are uploaded in the block, but mainly links to a fullscreen overview page where the full functionality of the plugin is provided. If you want to provide the plugin in every course by default without requiring that the teachers adds it to the course, please have a look at Moodle core's $CFG->defaultblocks setting which is set in config.php only and which is described on https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/config-dist.php. As an alternative to placing the block by default, you might also want to add a link to the plugin's overview page to the Boost nav drawer. This plugin does not offer support for adding a Boost nav drawer item itself, but we would like to reference the https://moodle.org/plugins/local_boostnavigation plugin for this job. After installing local_boostnavigation to your Moodle instance, please add the following line to the local_boostnavigation | insertcustomcoursenodesusers setting: Opencast Videos|/blocks/opencast/index.php?courseid={courseid}|||editingteacher,manager|admin|OR|fa-film|opencast|grades Please take extra care that the editingteacher,manager list of roles should match the list of roles who are given the block/opencast:addvideo capability in your Moodle instance. After adding the Boost nav drawer item, you can also remove the block/opencast:addinstance capability from all roles as adding the block is not really necessary anymore. Export and import settings If you want to export and import the administrator settings of the block, you can use the Admin presets block. The admin presets block can be added to the frontpage (https://yourmoodlesite.com/?redirect=0). After adding the block, you can select which settings to export or choose a file from which settings should be imported.","title":"About"},{"location":"block/about/#opencast-block-plugin","text":"This block can be used to link moodle courses to Opencast series.

However, there is no out of the box workflow defined in Opencast, which allows to duplicate a series. Own workflows If you want to create your own workflow, here are the descriptions of the general restore process: In the restore process, we first create a new opencast series for the new course. Afterwards, for each event UID of the backup a 'duplicate' workflow is started, while the new series UID is given as a configuration parameter to the start workflow call. The variable used to store the series ID is 'seriesID'. In our workflow definition example from above, the first workflow lms-automated-duplicate will duplicate the event and will start a new workflow for the new event. This second workflow lms-publish-duplicate then assigns the series of the new course to the new event.

The core functionality is to upload a video file to Moodle, which is then transferred to opencast. This is done via a cronjob, which processes all Upload Jobs in a first in first out fashion. Please make sure that the Maximum Time limit for cron execution in Site administration -> Server -> Performance is not restricted (value of 0 means no time limit). Then the cron job is not terminated early. Settings for upload jobs In this section you can define the following settings: Limit upload job by cron: How many videos are uploaded within one run of the cronjob. If it is set to 0, the number of videos is not limited. Workflow to start after upload: Workflow: Set the unique shortname of the workflow that should be started after successfully uploading a video file to Opencast. When using the default workflows it is recommended to use the Studio Upload workflow. Publish to Engage: Select whether the videos should be published to the engage player. This results in the configuration field 'publishToEngage' to be set to true or false for the called workflow (only useful if the selected workflow supports this). When using the default workflows this checkbox needs to be ticked. Reuse existing uploads: Select if multiple videos with the same content hash are uploaded to opencast only once. This is a legacy feature: Not recommended to be used. With our further development we strive to create one series per course. Allow unassign from course others a 'delete' icon to the teacher, which will unassign the event from the series of the course. This is a legacy feature: Only useful if events should not actually be deleted! Workflow to start before event is be deleted: Setup the unique shortname of the workflow that should be started for deleting a video file in Opencast. If a workflow is selected, a 'delete' icon is offered to the teacher, which will actually delete the event in the Opencast system. When using the default workflows it is recommended to use the Delete workflow. We recommend to use only one of the two previous 'delete' options! Delete videofile from Moodle: This setting causes the Moodle system to delete the file of the uploaded video as soon as possible. If set to false, the video file will remain in the Moodle system in the draft area until a cron job deletes it (usually some days later). Allowed file extensions: With 'Allowed file extensions' you can specify which file extensions users can upload as videos. The extensions must exist as file types in Moodle under Site administration -> Server -> File types. If left blank all of Moodle's file types in the type group 'video' are allowed. Settings for a block instance In this section the number of videos that is displayed can be configured. Number of videos: Maximum number of videos to display in the block. Cache valid time: Time in seconds, before the cache for the video data of each course is refreshed. Group and series In this section it can be configured how groups and series created by Moodle are named in Opencast. In both cases the options [COURSEID] and [COURSENAME] are available which are placeholders for the numeric course ID and for the course name. The configuration options are: Create a group: If checked, a group is created during the upload. This is a legacy feature, which assigns each uploaded event to a Opencast group. Group name: Group to which the video is added. Important: The group name length is restricted to 128 Bytes. You can use the placeholders which are automatically replaced. Series name: Series to which the video is added. You can use the placeholders which are automatically replaced. Roles In this section you can define which ACL rules are added to a video. You can add and delete roles and define the respective actions for these roles. This might only be relevant if you want to control the access privileges for your opencast videos via Moodle. In this case it is recommended that you setup the moodle-role-provider for your Opencast system (https://docs.opencast.org/develop/admin/configuration/security.user.moodle/). It is possible to select if roles should be permanent or not. Non-permanent roles can be used to manually change the access of certain user groups (e.g. students) for each video. Roles which are not permanent will be removed if the video is hidden in the block overview and added again if the video is made visible. To use this feature, you need to define at least one non-permanent role-action combination and the name of opencast workflow for republishing metadata. When using the default Opencast workflows this is Republish Metadata . In the video overview of the block, the instructors are able to change the visibility of each video. However, the icon to do so, is only present if the two requirements mentioned above are met! This process takes some time, since the opencast workflow needs to finish. In the ACL Roles you can use placeholders . To give an example for Roles, which also meets the LTI standard and which is used by the plugin by default, you can use the following setting: Role Actions Permanent ROLE_ADMIN write,read Yes ROLE_GROUP_MH_DEFAULT_ORG_EXTERNAL_APPLICATIONS write,read Yes [COURSEID]_Instructor write,read Yes [COURSEGROUPID]_Learner read No Metadata In this section it can be configured which metadata instructors can provide as well as which metadata instructors have to provide. By default instructors have to provide the title of a video. Placeholders For some settings, you can use placeholders that are replaced when dealing with names for Opencast (e.g. when creating a series). The following placeholders are available: [COURSEID] : Will be replaced by the id of the course. [COURSENAME] : Will be replaced by the name of the course. [COURSEGROUPID] : Should only be used in non-permanent roles. Depending on the visibility of the event, it is either replaced by the id of the course or (in case the visibility is restricted by groups) it is replaced by a 'G' followed by the id of the group. In case that multiple groups are selected in the visibility dialog, one ACL rule for every group is created. The basic role including the course id is removed in the case of group visibility.

Workflow for duplicating events: This workflow is needed for restoring opencast events from one course into another. If not set, it is not possible to restore Opencast events.

Users with respective privileges (in the following called teacher) can specify the ID of an existing Opencast episode/series to add it to their course. An embedded player allows students to watch the videos directly in Moodle. As with every activity, the teachers can restrict the access to the videos for students based on e.g. dates, grades or user profiles. The Paella player is used to play the videos. The Opencast Videos block offers the functionality to add activities so that teachers don't have to explicitly specify the Opencast IDs. Installation The Opencast activity plugin is available from GitHub . Usage scenarios In the following, the two usage scenarios, providing a series or an episode, are described. Use case 1 - Provide a series The teacher wants to provide a series for students. For example, this series contains all lecture recordings. Steps to add the activity: 1. Add a new \"Video (Opencast)\" activity. 2. Enter the Opencast id of the series you want to display: 3. If you want, you can specify further configurations like access restrictions. 4. The videos in the series can be either displayed in a list view or in a preview view: Use case 2 - Provide an episode The teacher wants to provide a single episode for students. For example, this episode belongs to a specific lecture. 1. Add a new \"Video (Opencast)\" activity. 2. Enter the Opencast id of the episode you want to display as in the previous use case. The activity automatically recognizes that the entered id is an episode. 3. If you want, you can specify further configurations like access restrictions. 4.
